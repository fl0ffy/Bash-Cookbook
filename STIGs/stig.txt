Group Title:  SRG-OS-999999
Rule ID:  SV-50255r1_rule
Severity: CAT III
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000001
Rule Title: The system must use a separate file system for /tmp.


Vulnerability Discussion:  The "/tmp" partition is used as temporary storage by many programs. Placing "/tmp" in its own partition enables the setting of more restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.


Check Content:  
Run the following command to determine if "/tmp" is on its own partition or logical volume: 

$ mount | grep "on /tmp "

If "/tmp" has its own partition or volume group, a line will be returned. 
If no line is returned, this is a finding.

Fix Text: The "/tmp" directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary file storage. Ensure it has its own partition or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.

Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000002
Rule Title: The system must use a separate file system for /var.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Ensuring that "/var" is mounted on its own partition enables the setting of more restrictive mount options. This helps protect system services such as daemons or other programs which use it. It is not uncommon for the "/var" directory to contain world-writable directories, installed by other software packages.


Check Content:  
Run the following command to determine if "/var" is on its own partition or logical volume: 

$ mount | grep "on /var "

If "/var" has its own partition or volume group, a line will be returned. 
If no line is returned, this is a finding.

Fix Text: The "/var" directory is used by daemons and other system services to store frequently-changing data. Ensure that "/var" has its own partition or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.

Rule Title: The system must use a separate file system for /var/log.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Placing "/var/log" in its own partition enables better separation between log files and other files in "/var/".


Check Content:  
Run the following command to determine if "/var/log" is on its own partition or logical volume: 

$ mount | grep "on /var/log "

If "/var/log" has its own partition or volume group, a line will be returned. 
If no line is returned, this is a finding.

Fix Text: System logs are stored in the "/var/log" directory. Ensure that it has its own partition or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.

Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000004
Rule Title: The system must use a separate file system for the system audit data path.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Placing "/var/log/audit" in its own partition enables better separation between audit files and other files, and helps ensure that auditing cannot be halted due to the partition running out of space.


Check Content:  
Run the following command to determine if "/var/log/audit" is on its own partition or logical volume: 

$ mount | grep "on /var/log/audit "

If "/var/log/audit" has its own partition or volume group, a line will be returned. 
If no line is returned, this is a finding.

Fix Text: Audit logs are stored in the "/var/log/audit" directory. Ensure that it has its own partition or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it later using LVM. Make absolutely certain that it is large enough to store all audit logs that will be created by the auditing daemon.

Group Title:  SRG-OS-000045
Rule ID:  SV-50270r1_rule
Severity: CAT II
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000005
Rule Title: The audit system must alert designated staff members when the audit storage volume approaches capacity.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Notifying administrators of an impending disk space problem may allow them to take corrective action prior to any disruption.


Check Content:  
Inspect "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" and locate the following line to determine if the system is configured to email the administrator when disk space is starting to run low: 

# grep space_left_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf
space_left_action = email


If the system is not configured to send an email to the system administrator when disk space is starting to run low, this is a finding.

Fix Text: The "auditd" service can be configured to take an action when disk space starts to run low. Edit the file "/etc/audit/auditd.conf". Modify the following line, substituting [ACTION] appropriately: 

space_left_action = [ACTION]

Possible values for [ACTION] are described in the "auditd.conf" man page. These include: 

"ignore"
"syslog"
"email"
"exec"
"suspend"
"single"
"halt"


Set this to "email" (instead of the default, which is "suspend") as it is more likely to get prompt attention.

RHEL-06-000521 ensures that the email generated through the operation "space_left_action" will be sent to an administrator.

Group Title:  SRG-OS-999999
Rule ID:  SV-50273r1_rule
Severity: CAT III
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000007
Rule Title: The system must use a separate file system for user home directories.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Ensuring that "/home" is mounted on its own partition enables the setting of more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.


Check Content:  
Run the following command to determine if "/home" is on its own partition or logical volume: 

$ mount | grep "on /home "

If "/home" has its own partition or volume group, a line will be returned. 
If no line is returned, this is a finding.

Fix Text: If user home directories will be stored locally, create a separate partition for "/home" at installation time (or migrate it later using LVM). If "/home" will be mounted from another system such as an NFS server, then creating a separate partition is not necessary at installation time, and the mountpoint can instead be configured later.

Rule ID:  SV-50276r1_rule
Severity: CAT I
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000008
Rule Title: Vendor-provided cryptographic certificates must be installed to verify the integrity of system software.


Vulnerability Discussion:  This key is necessary to cryptographically verify packages are from Red Hat.


Check Content:  
To ensure that the GPG key is installed, run: 

$ rpm -q --queryformat "%{SUMMARY}\n" gpg-pubkey

The command should return the string below: 

gpg(Red Hat, Inc. (release key <security@redhat.com>)


If the Red Hat GPG Key is not installed, this is a finding.

Fix Text: To ensure the system can cryptographically verify base software packages come from Red Hat (and to connect to the Red Hat Network to receive them if desired), the Red Hat GPG key must properly be installed. To ensure the GPG key is installed, run: 

# rhn_register   

CCI: CCI-000352
_____________________________________________________________

Group ID (Vulid):  V-38478
Group Title:  SRG-OS-000096
Rule ID:  SV-50278r1_rule
Severity: CAT III
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000009
Rule Title: The Red Hat Network Service (rhnsd) service must not be running, unless using RHN or an RHN Satellite.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Although systems management and patching is extremely important to system security, management by a system outside the enterprise enclave is not desirable for some environments. However, if the system is being managed by RHN or RHN Satellite Server the "rhnsd" daemon can remain on.


Check Content:  
If the system uses RHN or is an RHN Satellite, this is not applicable.

To check that the "rhnsd" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command: 

# chkconfig "rhnsd" --list

Output should indicate the "rhnsd" service has either not been installed, or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below: 

# chkconfig "rhnsd" --list
"rhnsd" 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off

Run the following command to verify "rhnsd" is disabled through current runtime configuration: 

# service rhnsd status

If the service is disabled the command will return the following output: 

rhnsd is stopped


If the service is running, this is a finding.

Fix Text: The Red Hat Network service automatically queries Red Hat Network servers to determine whether there are any actions that should be executed, such as package updates. This only occurs if the system was registered to an RHN server or satellite and managed as such. The "rhnsd" service can be disabled with the following command: 

# chkconfig rhnsd off

Group Title:  SRG-OS-000191
Rule ID:  SV-50281r1_rule
Severity: CAT II
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000011
Rule Title: System security patches and updates must be installed and up-to-date.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against the exploitation of publicly-known vulnerabilities.


Check Content:  
If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server, or a yum server which provides updates, invoking the following command will indicate if updates are available: 

# yum check-update

If the system is not configured to update from one of these sources, run the following command to list when each package was last updated: 

$ rpm -qa -last

Compare this to Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) listed at https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/active/ to determine whether the system is missing applicable security and bugfix updates. 
If updates are not installed, this is a finding.

Fix Text: If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server, or a yum server, run the following command to install updates: 

# yum update

If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages) can be manually downloaded from the Red Hat Network and installed using "rpm".

Rule ID:  SV-50283r1_rule
Severity: CAT II
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000013
Rule Title: The system package management tool must cryptographically verify the authenticity of system software packages during installation.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Ensuring the validity of packages' cryptographic signatures prior to installation ensures the provenance of the software and protects against malicious tampering.


Check Content:  
To determine whether "yum" is configured to use "gpgcheck", inspect "/etc/yum.conf" and ensure the following appears in the "[main]" section: 

gpgcheck=1

A value of "1" indicates that "gpgcheck" is enabled. Absence of a "gpgcheck" line or a setting of "0" indicates that it is disabled. 
If GPG checking is not enabled, this is a finding.

If the "yum" system package management tool is not used to update the system, verify with the SA that installed packages are cryptographically signed.

Fix Text: The "gpgcheck" option should be used to ensure checking of an RPM package's signature always occurs prior to its installation. To configure yum to check package signatures before installing them, ensure the following line appears in "/etc/yum.conf" in the "[main]" section: 

gpgcheck=1

Severity: CAT III
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000015
Rule Title: The system package management tool must cryptographically verify the authenticity of all software packages during installation.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Ensuring all packages' cryptographic signatures are valid prior to installation ensures the provenance of the software and protects against malicious tampering.


Check Content:  
To determine whether "yum" has been configured to disable "gpgcheck" for any repos, inspect all files in "/etc/yum.repos.d" and ensure the following does not appear in any sections: 

gpgcheck=0

A value of "0" indicates that "gpgcheck" has been disabled for that repo. 
If GPG checking is disabled, this is a finding.

If the "yum" system package management tool is not used to update the system, verify with the SA that installed packages are cryptographically signed.

Fix Text: To ensure signature checking is not disabled for any repos, remove any lines from files in "/etc/yum.repos.d" of the form: 

gpgcheck=0

Severity: CAT II
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000016
Rule Title: A file integrity tool must be installed.


Vulnerability Discussion:  The AIDE package must be installed if it is to be available for integrity checking.


Check Content:  
If another file integrity tool is installed, this is not a finding.

Run the following command to determine if the "aide" package is installed: 

# rpm -q aide


If the package is not installed, this is a finding.

Fix Text: Install the AIDE package with the command: 

# yum install aide

Severity: CAT I
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000019
Rule Title: There must be no .rhosts or hosts.equiv files on the system.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Trust files are convenient, but when used in conjunction with the R-services, they can allow unauthenticated access to a system.


Check Content:  
The existence of the file "/etc/hosts.equiv" or a file named ".rhosts" inside a user home directory indicates the presence of an Rsh trust relationship. 
If these files exist, this is a finding.

Fix Text: The files "/etc/hosts.equiv" and "~/.rhosts" (in each user's home directory) list remote hosts and users that are trusted by the local system when using the rshd daemon. To remove these files, run the following command to delete them from any location. 

# rm /etc/hosts.equiv



$ rm ~/.rhosts

Severity: CAT II
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000027
Rule Title: The system must prevent the root account from logging in from virtual consoles.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Preventing direct root login to virtual console devices helps ensure accountability for actions taken on the system using the root account. 


Check Content:  
To check for virtual console entries which permit root login, run the following command: 

# grep '^vc/[0-9]' /etc/securetty

If any output is returned, then root logins over virtual console devices is permitted. 
If root login over virtual console devices is permitted, this is a finding.

Fix Text: To restrict root logins through the (deprecated) virtual console devices, ensure lines of this form do not appear in "/etc/securetty": 

vc/1
vc/2
vc/3
vc/4

Note: Virtual console entries are not limited to those listed above. Any lines starting with "vc/" followed by numerals should be removed.

Rule Title: The system must prevent the root account from logging in from serial consoles.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Preventing direct root login to serial port interfaces helps ensure accountability for actions taken on the systems using the root account.


Check Content:  
To check for serial port entries which permit root login, run the following command: 

# grep '^ttyS[0-9]' /etc/securetty

If any output is returned, then root login over serial ports is permitted. 
If root login over serial ports is permitted, this is a finding.

Fix Text: To restrict root logins on serial ports, ensure lines of this form do not appear in "/etc/securetty": 

ttyS0
ttyS1

Note: Serial port entries are not limited to those listed above. Any lines starting with "ttyS" followed by numerals should be removed

Severity: CAT II
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000029
Rule Title: Default system accounts, other than root, must be locked.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Disabling authentication for default system accounts makes it more difficult for attackers to make use of them to compromise a system.


Check Content:  
To obtain a listing of all users and the contents of their shadow password field, run the command: 

$ awk -F: '{print $1 ":" $2}' /etc/shadow

Identify the system accounts from this listing. These will primarily be the accounts with UID numbers less than 500, other than root. 
If any system account (other than root) has a valid password hash, this is a finding.

Fix Text: Some accounts are not associated with a human user of the system, and exist to perform some administrative function. An attacker should not be able to log into these accounts. 

Disable login access to these accounts with the command: 

# passwd -l [SYSACCT]

Severity: CAT I
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000030
Rule Title: The system must not have accounts configured with blank or null passwords.


Vulnerability Discussion:  If an account has an empty password, anyone could log in and run commands with the privileges of that account. Accounts with empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.


Check Content:  
To verify that null passwords cannot be used, run the following command: 

# grep nullok /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac

If this produces any output, it may be possible to log into accounts with empty passwords. 
If NULL passwords can be used, this is a finding.

Fix Text: If an account is configured for password authentication but does not have an assigned password, it may be possible to log into the account without authentication. Remove any instances of the "nullok" option in "/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac" to prevent logins with empty passwords.

Severity: CAT II
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000031
Rule Title: The /etc/passwd file must not contain password hashes.


Vulnerability Discussion:  The hashes for all user account passwords should be stored in the file "/etc/shadow" and never in "/etc/passwd", which is readable by all users.


Check Content:  
To check that no password hashes are stored in "/etc/passwd", run the following command: 

# awk -F: '($2 != "x") {print}' /etc/passwd

If it produces any output, then a password hash is stored in "/etc/passwd". 
If any stored hashes are found in /etc/passwd, this is a finding.

Fix Text: If any password hashes are stored in "/etc/passwd" (in the second field, instead of an "x"), the cause of this misconfiguration should be investigated. The account should have its password reset and the hash should be properly stored, or the account should be deleted entirely.

Severity: CAT II
Rule Version (STIG-ID):  RHEL-06-000032
Rule Title: The root account must be the only account having a UID of 0.


Vulnerability Discussion:  An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts with a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to guess a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of sudo is recommended to afford multiple system administrators access to root privileges in an accountable manner.


Check Content:  
To list all password file entries for accounts with UID 0, run the following command: 

# awk -F: '($3 == "0") {print}' /etc/passwd

This should print only one line, for the user root. 
If any account other than root has a UID of 0, this is a finding.

Fix Text: If any account other than root has a UID of 0, this misconfiguration should be investigated and the accounts other than root should be removed or have their UID changed.

Rule Title: The /etc/shadow file must be owned by root.


Vulnerability Discussion:  The "/etc/shadow" file contains the list of local system accounts and stores password hashes. Protection of this file is critical for system security. Failure to give ownership of this file to root provides the designated owner with access to sensitive information which could weaken the system security posture.


Check Content:  
To check the ownership of "/etc/shadow", run the command: 

$ ls -l /etc/shadow

If properly configured, the output should indicate the following owner: "root" 
If it does not, this is a finding.

Rule Title: The system must require passwords to contain a minimum of 14 characters.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Requiring a minimum password length makes password cracking attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger search space. However, any security benefit from an onerous requirement must be carefully weighed against usability problems, support costs, or counterproductive behavior that may result.

While it does not negate the password length requirement, it is preferable to migrate from a password-based authentication scheme to a stronger one based on PKI (public key infrastructure).

The output should show the following: 

password --encrypted "$6$[rest-of-the-password-hash]"


If it does not, this is a finding.

Fix Text: The grub boot loader should have password protection enabled to protect boot-time settings. To do so, select a password and then generate a hash from it by running the following command: 

# grub-crypt --sha-512

When prompted to enter a password, insert the following line into "/etc/grub.conf" immediately after the header comments. (Use the output from "grub-crypt" as the value of [password-hash]): 

password --encrypted [password-hash]

Rule Title: The system must require authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes.


Vulnerability Discussion:  This prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing security on the machine and gaining root access. Such accesses are further prevented by configuring the bootloader password.


Check Content:  
To check if authentication is required for single-user mode, run the following command: 

$ grep SINGLE /etc/sysconfig/init

The output should be the following: 

SINGLE=/sbin/sulogin


If the output is different, this is a finding.

Fix Text: Single-user mode is intended as a system recovery method, providing a single user root access to the system by providing a boot option at startup. By default, no authentication is performed if single-user mode is selected. 

To require entry of the root password even if the system is started in single-user mode, add or correct the following line in the file "/etc/sysconfig/init": 

SINGLE=/sbin/sulogin

Vulnerability Discussion:  Using interactive boot, the console user could disable auditing, firewalls, or other services, weakening system security.


Check Content:  
To check whether interactive boot is disabled, run the following command:

If interactive boot is disabled, the output will show: 

PROMPT=no


If it does not, this is a finding.

Fix Text: To disable the ability for users to perform interactive startups, edit the file "/etc/sysconfig/init". Add or correct the line: 

PROMPT=no

The "PROMPT" option allows the console user to perform an interactive system startup, in which it is possible to select the set of services which are started on boot.

Rule Title: The IPv6 protocol handler must not be bound to the network stack unless needed.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Any unnecessary network stacks - including IPv6 - should be disabled, to reduce the vulnerability to exploitation.


Check Content:  
If the system uses IPv6, this is not applicable.

If the system is configured to prevent the loading of the "ipv6" kernel module, it will contain a line of the form: 

options ipv6 disable=1

Such lines may be inside any file in "/etc/modprobe.d" or the deprecated "/etc/modprobe.conf". This permits insertion of the IPv6 kernel module (which other parts of the system expect to be present), but otherwise keeps it inactive. Run the following command to search for such lines in all files in "/etc/modprobe.d" and the deprecated "/etc/modprobe.conf": 

$ grep -r ipv6 /etc/modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.d


If the IPv6 kernel module is loaded, this is a finding.

Fix Text: To prevent the IPv6 kernel module ("ipv6") from loading the IPv6 networking stack, add the following line to "/etc/modprobe.d/disabled.conf" (or another file in "/etc/modprobe.d"): 

options ipv6 disable=1

This permits the IPv6 module to be loaded (and thus satisfy other modules that depend on it), while disabling support for the IPv6 protocol.

num_logs = [NUMLOGS]

Set the value to 5 for general-purpose systems. Note that values less than 2 result in no log rotation.

Rule Title: The system must set a maximum audit log file size.


Vulnerability Discussion:  The total storage for audit log files must be large enough to retain log information over the period required. This is a function of the maximum log file size and the number of logs retained.


Check Content:  
Inspect "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" and locate the following line to determine how much data the system will retain in each audit log file: "# grep max_log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf" 

max_log_file = 6


If the system audit data threshold hasn't been properly set up, this is a finding.

Fix Text: Determine the amount of audit data (in megabytes) which should be retained in each log file. Edit the file "/etc/audit/auditd.conf". Add or modify the following line, substituting the correct value for [STOREMB]: 

max_log_file = [STOREMB]

Set the value to "6" (MB) or higher for general-purpose systems. Larger values, of course, support retention of even more audit data.

Rule Title: The system must rotate audit log files that reach the maximum file size.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Automatically rotating logs (by setting this to "rotate") minimizes the chances of the system unexpectedly running out of disk space by being overwhelmed with log data. However, for systems that must never discard log data, or which use external processes to transfer it and reclaim space, "keep_logs" can be employed.


Check Content:  
Inspect "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" and locate the following line to determine if the system is configured to rotate logs when they reach their maximum size: "# grep max_log_file_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf" 

max_log_file_action "rotate"


If the system has not been properly set up to rotate audit logs, this is a finding.

Fix Text: The default action to take when the logs reach their maximum size is to rotate the log files, discarding the oldest one. To configure the action taken by "auditd", add or correct the line in "/etc/audit/auditd.conf": 

max_log_file_action = [ACTION]

Possible values for [ACTION] are described in the "auditd.conf" man page. These include: 

"ignore"
"syslog"
"suspend"
"rotate"
"keep_logs"


Set the "[ACTION]" to "rotate" to ensure log rotation occurs. This is the default. The setting is case-insensitive.

Vulnerability Discussion:  Causing idle users to be automatically logged out guards against compromises one system leading trivially to compromises on another.


Check Content:  
Run the following command to see what the timeout interval is: 

# grep ClientAliveInterval /etc/ssh/sshd_config

If properly configured, the output should be: 

ClientAliveInterval 900


If it is not, this is a finding.

Fix Text: SSH allows administrators to set an idle timeout interval. After this interval has passed, the idle user will be automatically logged out. 

To set an idle timeout interval, edit the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" as follows: 

ClientAliveInterval [interval]

The timeout [interval] is given in seconds. To have a timeout of 15 minutes, set [interval] to 900. 

If a shorter timeout has already been set for the login shell, that value will preempt any SSH setting made here. Keep in mind that some processes may stop SSH from correctly detecting that the user is idle.

Vulnerability Discussion:  Synchronizing with an NTP server makes it possible to collate system logs from multiple sources or correlate computer events with real time events. Using a trusted NTP server provided by your organization is recommended.


Check Content:  
A remote NTP server should be configured for time synchronization. To verify one is configured, open the following file.

Vulnerability Discussion:  Allowing users to execute binaries from removable media such as USB keys exposes the system to potential compromise.


Check Content:  
To verify that binaries cannot be directly executed from removable media, run the following command: 

# grep noexec /etc/fstab

The output should show "noexec" in use. 
If it does not, this is a finding.

Fix Text: The "noexec" mount option prevents the direct execution of binaries on the mounted filesystem. Users should not be allowed to execute binaries that exist on partitions mounted from removable media (such as a USB key). The "noexec" option prevents code from being executed directly from the media itself, and may therefore provide a line of defense against certain types of worms or malicious code. Add the "noexec" option to the fourth column of "/etc/fstab" for the line which controls mounting of any removable media partitions.

Check Content:  
Determine if encryption must be used to protect data on the system. 
If encryption must be used and is not employed, this is a finding.

Fix Text: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 natively supports partition encryption through the Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to encrypt a partition is during installation time. 

For manual installations, select the "Encrypt" checkbox during partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually every time the system boots. 

For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding the "--encrypted" and "--passphrase=" options to the definition of each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition: 

part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=[PASSPHRASE]

Any [PASSPHRASE] is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly. Omitting the "--passphrase=" option from the partition definition will cause the installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation. 

Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on the Red Had Documentation web site:

A "c" in the second column indicates that a file is a configuration file, which may appropriately be expected to change. If the file that has changed was not expected to then refresh from distribution media or online repositories. 

rpm -Uvh [affected_package]

OR 

yum reinstall [affected_package]

Rule Title: There must be no world-writable files on the system.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Data in world-writable files can be modified by any user on the system. In almost all circumstances, files can be configured using a combination of user and group permissions to support whatever legitimate access is needed without the risk caused by world-writable files.


Check Content:  
To find world-writable files, run the following command: 

# find / -xdev -type f -perm -002


If there is output, this is a finding.

Fix Text: It is generally a good idea to remove global (other) write access to a file when it is discovered. However, check with documentation for specific applications before making changes. Also, monitor for recurring world-writable files, as these may be symptoms of a misconfigured application or user account.

Rule Title: The system must use and update a DoD-approved virus scan program.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Virus scanning software can be used to detect if a system has been compromised by computer viruses, as well as to limit their spread to other systems.


Check Content:  
Inspect the system for a cron job or system service which executes a virus scanning tool regularly. 
To verify the McAfee command line scan tool (uvscan) is scheduled for regular execution, run the following command to check for a cron job: 

# grep uvscan /etc/cron* /var/spool/cron/*

This will reveal if and when the uvscan program will be run. 
To check on the age of uvscan virus definition files, run the following command: 

# cd /usr/local/uvscan
# ls -la avvscan.dat avvnames.dat avvclean.dat

The uvscan virus definitions should not be older than seven days.

If virus scanning software does not run daily, or has signatures that are out of date, this is a finding.

Fix Text: Install virus scanning software, which uses signatures to search for the presence of viruses on the filesystem. The McAfee uvscan virus scanning tool is provided for DoD systems. Ensure virus definition files are no older than 7 days, or their last release. Configure the virus scanning software to perform scans dynamically on all accessed files. If this is not possible, configure the system to scan all altered files on the system on a daily basis. If the system processes inbound SMTP mail, configure the virus scanner to scan all received mail.

Rule Title: The system must have a host-based intrusion detection tool installed.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Adding host-based intrusion detection tools can provide the capability to automatically take actions in response to malicious behavior, which can provide additional agility in reacting to network threats. These tools also often include a reporting capability to provide network awareness of system, which may not otherwise exist in an organization's systems management regime.


Check Content:  
Inspect the system to determine if intrusion detection software has been installed. Verify the intrusion detection software is active. 
If no host-based intrusion detection tools are installed, this is a finding.

Fix Text: The base Red Hat platform already includes a sophisticated auditing system that can detect intruder activity, as well as SELinux, which provides host-based intrusion prevention capabilities by confining privileged programs and user sessions which may become compromised. 

Install an additional intrusion detection tool to provide complementary or duplicative monitoring, reporting, and reaction capabilities to those of the base platform. For DoD systems, the McAfee Host-based Security System is provided to fulfill this role.

Rule Title: The x86 Ctrl-Alt-Delete key sequence must be disabled.


Vulnerability Discussion:  A locally logged-in user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when at the console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the GNOME graphical environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.


Check Content:  
Determine what actions the system takes when the Ctrl-Alt-Delete key sequence is pressed, run the following command:

# cat `grep -l control-alt-delete /etc/init/*`

Examine all lines following the "start on control-alt-delete" line in any files found. By default, the system uses "/etc/init/control-alt-delete.conf" to reboot the system with the following command when the Ctrl-Alt-Delete key sequence is pressed: 

exec /sbin/shutdown -r now "Control-Alt-Delete pressed"

If the system is configured to run any shutdown command, this is a finding.

Fix Text: Configure the system to log a message instead of rebooting the system by altering the "shutdown" line in "/etc/init/control-alt-delete.conf" to read as follows: 

exec /usr/bin/logger -p security.info "Ctrl-Alt-Delete pressed"

Fix Text: The Postfix mail transfer agent is used for local mail delivery within the system. The default configuration only listens for connections to the default SMTP port (port 25) on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1). It is recommended to leave this service enabled for local mail delivery. The "postfix" service can be enabled with the following command: 

# chkconfig postfix on

Check Content:  
To check that the "netconsole" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command: 

# chkconfig "netconsole" --list

Output should indicate the "netconsole" service has either not been installed, or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below: 

# chkconfig "netconsole" --list
"netconsole" 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off

Run the following command to verify "netconsole" is disabled through current runtime configuration: 

# service netconsole status

If the service is disabled the command will return the following output: 

netconsole is stopped


If the service is running, this is a finding.

Fix Text: The "netconsole" service is responsible for loading the netconsole kernel module, which logs kernel printk messages over UDP to a syslog server. This allows debugging of problems where disk logging fails and serial consoles are impractical. The "netconsole" service can be disabled with the following command: 

# chkconfig netconsole off

Check Content:  
To verify insecure file locking has been disabled, run the following command:

Fix Text: By default the NFS server requires secure file-lock requests, which require credentials from the client in order to lock a file. Most NFS clients send credentials with file lock requests, however, there are a few clients that do not send credentials when requesting a file-lock, allowing the client to only be able to lock world-readable files. To get around this, the "insecure_locks" option can be used so these clients can access the desired export. This poses a security risk by potentially allowing the client access to data for which it does not have authorization. Remove any instances of the "insecure_locks" option from the file "/etc/exports".

Vulnerability Discussion:  If Bluetooth functionality must be disabled, preventing the kernel from loading the kernel module provides an additional safeguard against its activation.


Check Content:  
If the system is configured to prevent the loading of the "bluetooth" kernel module, it will contain lines inside any file in "/etc/modprobe.d" or the deprecated"/etc/modprobe.conf". These lines instruct the module loading system to run another program (such as "/bin/true") upon a module "install" event. Run the following command to search for such lines in all files in "/etc/modprobe.d" and the deprecated "/etc/modprobe.conf": 

$ grep -r bluetooth /etc/modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.d

If the system is configured to prevent the loading of the "net-pf-31" kernel module, it will contain lines inside any file in "/etc/modprobe.d" or the deprecated"/etc/modprobe.conf". These lines instruct the module loading system to run another program (such as "/bin/true") upon a module "install" event. Run the following command to search for such lines in all files in "/etc/modprobe.d" and the deprecated "/etc/modprobe.conf": 

$ grep -r net-pf-31 /etc/modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.d


If no line is returned, this is a finding.

Fix Text: The kernel's module loading system can be configured to prevent loading of the Bluetooth module. Add the following to the appropriate "/etc/modprobe.d" configuration file to prevent the loading of the Bluetooth module: 

install net-pf-31 /bin/true
install bluetooth /bin/true

Rule Title: The system must limit users to 10 simultaneous system logins, or a site-defined number, in accordance with operational requirements.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Limiting simultaneous user logins can insulate the system from denial of service problems caused by excessive logins. Automated login processes operating improperly or maliciously may result in an exceptional number of simultaneous login sessions.


Check Content:  
Run the following command to ensure the "maxlogins" value is configured for all users on the system: 

# grep "maxlogins" /etc/security/limits.conf

You should receive output similar to the following: 

* hard maxlogins 10

If it is not set to 10 or a documented site-defined number, this is a finding.

Fix Text: Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user can limit risks related to denial of service attacks. This addresses concurrent sessions for a single account and does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple accounts. To set the number of concurrent sessions per user add the following line in "/etc/security/limits.conf": 

* hard maxlogins 10

A documented site-defined number may be substituted for 10 in the above.

Rule Title: The systems local firewall must implement a deny-all, allow-by-exception policy for forwarded packets.


Vulnerability Discussion:  In "iptables" the default policy is applied only after all the applicable rules in the table are examined for a match. Setting the default policy to "DROP" implements proper design for a firewall, i.e., any packets which are not explicitly permitted should not be accepted.


Check Content:  
Run the following command to ensure the default "FORWARD" policy is "DROP": 

grep ":FORWARD" /etc/sysconfig/iptables

The output must be the following: 

# grep ":FORWARD" /etc/sysconfig/iptables
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]

If it is not, this is a finding.

Rule Title: The Bluetooth service must be disabled.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Disabling the "bluetooth" service prevents the system from attempting connections to Bluetooth devices, which entails some security risk. Nevertheless, variation in this risk decision may be expected due to the utility of Bluetooth connectivity and its limited range.


Check Content:  
To check that the "bluetooth" service is disabled in system boot configuration, run the following command: 

# chkconfig "bluetooth" --list

Output should indicate the "bluetooth" service has either not been installed, or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below: 

# chkconfig "bluetooth" --list
"bluetooth" 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off

Run the following command to verify "bluetooth" is disabled through current runtime configuration: 

# service bluetooth status

If the service is disabled the command will return the following output: 

bluetooth is stopped


If the service is running, this is a finding.

Fix Text: The "bluetooth" service can be disabled with the following command: 

# chkconfig bluetooth off



# service bluetooth stop

Rule Title: Accounts must be locked upon 35 days of inactivity.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Disabling inactive accounts ensures that accounts which may not have been responsibly removed are not available to attackers who may have compromised their credentials.


Check Content:  
To verify the "INACTIVE" setting, run the following command: 

grep "INACTIVE" /etc/default/useradd

The output should indicate the "INACTIVE" configuration option is set to an appropriate integer as shown in the example below: 

# grep "INACTIVE" /etc/default/useradd
INACTIVE=35

If it does not, this is a finding.

Fix Text: To specify the number of days after a password expires (which signifies inactivity) until an account is permanently disabled, add or correct the following lines in "/etc/default/useradd", substituting "[NUM_DAYS]" appropriately: 

INACTIVE=[NUM_DAYS]

A value of 35 is recommended. If a password is currently on the verge of expiration, then 35 days remain until the account is automatically disabled. However, if the password will not expire for another 60 days, then 95 days could elapse until the account would be automatically disabled. See the "useradd" man page for more information. Determining the inactivity timeout must be done with careful consideration of the length of a "normal" period of inactivity for users in the particular environment. Setting the timeout too low incurs support costs and also has the potential to impact availability of the system to legitimate users.

Rule Title: The sticky bit must be set on all public directories.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized users to delete files in the directory structure. 

The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the system, or those designed to be temporary file repositories. The setting is normally reserved for directories used by the system, and by users for temporary file storage - such as /tmp - and for directories requiring global read/write access.


Check Content:  
To find world-writable directories that lack the sticky bit, run the following command: 

# find / -xdev -type d -perm 002 ! -perm 1000


If any world-writable directories are missing the sticky bit, this is a finding.

Fix Text: When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory, only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky bit prevents users from removing each other's files. In cases where there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application, consult that application's documentation instead of blindly changing modes. 
To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory [DIR], run the following command: 

# chmod +t [DIR]

Vulnerability Discussion:  Allowing a user account to own a world-writable directory is undesirable because it allows the owner of that directory to remove or replace any files that may be placed in the directory by other users.


Check Content:  
The following command will discover and print world-writable directories that are not owned by a system account, given the assumption that only system accounts have a uid lower than 500. Run it once for each local partition [PART]: 

# find [PART] -xdev -type d -perm 0002 -uid +500 -print


If there is output, this is a finding.

Fix Text: All directories in local partitions which are world-writable should be owned by root or another system account. If any world-writable directories are not owned by a system account, this should be investigated. Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an appropriate group.

Rule Title: The TFTP daemon must operate in secure mode which provides access only to a single directory on the host file system.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Using the "-s" option causes the TFTP service to only serve files from the given directory. Serving files from an intentionally specified directory reduces the risk of sharing files which should remain private.


Check Content:  
Verify "tftp" is configured by with the "-s" option by running the following command: 

grep "server_args" /etc/xinetd.d/tftp

# grep "server_args" /etc/xinetd.d/tftp
server_args = -s /var/lib/tftpboot

If it does not, this is a finding.

Fix Text: If running the "tftp" service is necessary, it should be configured to change its root directory at startup. To do so, ensure "/etc/xinetd.d/tftp" includes "-s" as a command line argument, as shown in the following example (which is also the default):

Rule Title: The system must be configured to require the use of a CAC, PIV compliant hardware token, or Alternate Logon Token (ALT) for authentication.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Smart card login provides two-factor authentication stronger than that provided by a username/password combination. Smart cards leverage a PKI (public key infrastructure) in order to provide and verify credentials.


Check Content:  
Interview the SA to determine if all accounts not exempted by policy are using CAC authentication. For DoD systems, the following systems and accounts are exempt from using smart card (CAC) authentication: 

SIPRNET systems
Standalone systems
Application accounts
Temporary employee accounts, such as students or interns, who cannot easily receive a CAC or PIV
Operational tactical locations that are not collocated with RAPIDS workstations to issue CAC or ALT
Test systems, such as those with an Interim Approval to Test (IATT) and use a separate VPN, firewall, or security measure preventing access to network and system components from outside the protection boundary documented in the IATT.



If non-exempt accounts are not using CAC authentication, this is a finding.

Vulnerability Discussion:  USB storage devices such as thumb drives can be used to introduce unauthorized software and other vulnerabilities. Support for these devices should be disabled and the devices themselves should be tightly controlled.


Check Content:  
If the system is configured to prevent the loading of the "usb-storage" kernel module, it will contain lines inside any file in "/etc/modprobe.d" or the deprecated"/etc/modprobe.conf". These lines instruct the module loading system to run another program (such as "/bin/true") upon a module "install" event. Run the following command to search for such lines in all files in "/etc/modprobe.d" and the deprecated "/etc/modprobe.conf": 

$ grep -r usb-storage /etc/modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.d


If no line is returned, this is a finding.

Fix Text: To prevent USB storage devices from being used, configure the kernel module loading system to prevent automatic loading of the USB storage driver. To configure the system to prevent the "usb-storage" kernel module from being loaded, add the following line to a file in the directory "/etc/modprobe.d": 

install usb-storage /bin/true

Setting the default policy to "DROP" implements proper design for a firewall, i.e., any packets which are not explicitly permitted should not be accepted.


Check Content:  
Inspect the file "/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables" to determine the default policy for the INPUT chain. It should be set to DROP. 

# grep ":INPUT" /etc/sysconfig/ip6tables

If the default policy for the INPUT chain is not set to DROP, this is a finding.

Fix Text: To set the default policy to DROP (instead of ACCEPT) for the built-in INPUT chain which processes incoming packets, add or correct the following line in "/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables": 

:INPUT DROP [0:0]

Rule Title: The system must provide automated support for account management functions.


Vulnerability Discussion:  A comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to ensure the accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Enterprise environments make user account management challenging and complex. A user management process requiring administrators to manually address account management functions adds risk of potential oversight.


Check Content:  
Interview the SA to determine if there is an automated system for managing user accounts, preferably integrated with an existing enterprise user management system.

If there is not, this is a finding.

Fix Text: Implement an automated system for managing user accounts that minimizes the risk of errors, either intentional or deliberate. If possible, this system should integrate with an existing enterprise user management system, such as, one based Active Directory or Kerberos.

Rule Title: Auditing must be enabled at boot by setting a kernel parameter.


Vulnerability Discussion:  Each process on the system carries an "auditable" flag which indicates whether its activities can be audited. Although "auditd" takes care of enabling this for all processes which launch after it does, adding the kernel argument ensures it is set for every process during boot.


Check Content:  
Inspect the kernel boot arguments (which follow the word "kernel") in "/etc/grub.conf". If they include "audit=1", then auditing is enabled at boot time. 
If auditing is not enabled at boot time, this is a finding.

Fix Text: To ensure all processes can be audited, even those which start prior to the audit daemon, add the argument "audit=1" to the kernel line in "/etc/grub.conf", in the manner below: 

kernel /vmlinuz-version ro vga=ext root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 rhgb quiet audit=1

Rule Title: Automated file system mounting tools must not be enabled unless needed.


Vulnerability Discussion:  All filesystems that are required for the successful operation of the system should be explicitly listed in "/etc/fstab" by an administrator. New filesystems should not be arbitrarily introduced via the automounter.

The "autofs" daemon mounts and unmounts filesystems, such as user home directories shared via NFS, on demand. In addition, autofs can be used to handle removable media, and the default configuration provides the cdrom device as "/misc/cd". However, this method of providing access to removable media is not common, so autofs can almost always be disabled if NFS is not in use. Even if NFS is required, it is almost always possible to configure filesystem mounts statically by editing "/etc/fstab" rather than relying on the automounter. 


Check Content:  
To verify the "autofs" service is disabled, run the following command: 

chkconfig --list autofs

If properly configured, the output should be the following: 

autofs 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off

Verify the "autofs" service is not running:

# service autofs status

If the autofs service is enabled or running, this is a finding.

Fix Text: If the "autofs" service is not needed to dynamically mount NFS filesystems or removable media, disable the service for all runlevels: 

# chkconfig --level 0123456 autofs off

Stop the service if it is already running: 

# service autofs stop
